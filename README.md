# GogoApps Inteview

- Added .vscode/settings.json with formatOnSave. Just for those who will use VSCode to be able format code on save. As a lot of time people are used to forget about this. If the teams don't need I'll definetely remove this part.

- Design System folder is used to add components that we can move in npm library in the future. It's something like Bootstrap, Material UI, Primer, but locally.
